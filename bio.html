            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                Hi, I’m Kennedy Thomas — a Computer Science student at Samford University with a passion for building reliable software and solving real-world problems through technology. 🤎
            </p>
            <p>
                Right now, I’m a Software Quality Assurance Intern at Altec, Inc., where I work with both manual and automated testing to ensure software performs as expected. 🛠️ I collaborate closely with developers, translate requirements into test cases, and help make products more efficient and dependable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of work, I’ve designed and developed projects like a course catalog application and an ad network database, where I combined backend logic with user-friendly interfaces. 💡 I enjoy working across the stack — whether it’s writing SQL queries, coding in Python or Java, or diving into automation tools like Katalon Studio and Azure DevOps.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m also active beyond the classroom and workplace. As Secretary of Omicron Mu: Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., I manage chapter communications and records, and I previously served as an Orientation Leader, mentoring students as they transitioned into college life. 🌿
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m always looking for new ways to grow in software engineering, QA automation, and backend development, while continuing to build technology that makes life simpler and more connected. ☁️
